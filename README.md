# Math

Welcome to the "Math" repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding various mathematical concepts and theories. Below are the primary topics covered in this repository:

## Topics Covered

### Probability Theory
Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of random phenomena. This section covers fundamental concepts such as probability distributions, expected value, variance, and more.

### Combinatorics
Combinatorics is the field of mathematics dealing with combinations of objects in specific sets under certain constraints. This section explores topics such as permutations, combinations, and the principles of counting.

### Newton's Binomial Theorem
Newton's Binomial Theorem provides a formula for expanding powers of a binomial. This section includes derivations, proofs, and applications of the theorem.

### Markov Chains
Markov Chains are mathematical systems that undergo transitions from one state to another within a finite or countable number of possible states. This section covers the fundamentals of Markov Chains, including state transition matrices, steady-state distributions, and applications.

### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. This section includes explanations, derivations, and examples of how Bayes' Theorem is used in probability theory.
